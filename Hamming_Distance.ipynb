    "## Hamming Distance\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The Hamming distance between two sequences of the same length is defined as the number of positions in which the two sequences don't match. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hamming distance is used, together with many other Computer Science tools, In Computational Biology to better understand the way DNA works. In fact, DNA sequences are long strings composed of four letters: A, C, G, T. The Hamming distance between them is a measure of how far two DNAs are from one another. For example, given the following two sequences\n",

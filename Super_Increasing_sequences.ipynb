    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence \\( L = [a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n] \\) of non-negative integers is called **super-increasing** if it satisfies the following property:\n",
    "\n",
    "For every \\( i > 0 \\), the sum of all preceding elements is strictly less than the \\( i \\)-th element in the sequence. Mathematically, this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_0 + a_1 + \\dots + a_{i-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{i-1}a_k < a_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sequence \\( [1, 3, 5, 11, 30] \\) is super-increasing because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( 1 < 3 \\)\n",
    "- \\( 1 + 3 = 4 < 5 \\)\n",
    "- \\( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 < 11 \\)\n",
    "- \\( 1 + 3 + 5 + 11 = 20 < 30 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the sequence \\( [1, 3, 8, 20, 30] \\) is not super-increasing, as \\( 1 + 3 + 8 + 20 = 32 \\), which is greater than 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a super-increasing sequence \\( L = [a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n] \\) and a number \\( N \\), which is the sum of some of the elements in the sequence, it can be proven that there is a unique way to select the elements from the sequence to obtain \\( N \\). This means that if we are provided with the value of \\( N \\), we can determine exactly which elements of the sequence sum up to \\( N \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to find a function that, given a super-increasing sequence \\( L \\) and a number \\( N \\), returns the list of elements from \\( L \\) that sum up to \\( N \\). If there is no such combination, the function should raise a `ValueError`.\n",

    "Start from any positive integer *n*. At every step do one of the following to get a new number:\n",
    "- if the number is even, divide it by two\n",
    "- if the number is odd, multiply it by three and add 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you start from 6. 6 is even, so the next number is 6/2=3. 3 is odd so we multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 10. 10 is even, we get 5. 5 is odd, so we get 16. Then we divide by 2, to get 8. Then again we divide by 2, to get 4 and from 4 we get 2, then 1, then back to 4 and we end up in a cycle 4, 2, 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Collatz Conjecture says that no matter the number you start from, you will end up in the 4, 2, 1 cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conjecture is still such, no one knows whether it is true or not.\n",
